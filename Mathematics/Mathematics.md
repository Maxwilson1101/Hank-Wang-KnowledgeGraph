# All about My Math
The real launchpad of my math odyssey was choosing to dive into the world of Applied Statistics for my postgrad. That decision totally rewrote my life's equation! It redefined the art of mathematics for me, immersing me in realms like [[probability]], [[statistics]], and [[real analysis]]. 

For me now, mathematics is both a language and a way of thinking. Currently, I am studying [[discrete mathematics]], [[geometry]] and [[complex analysis]], and I have a keen interest in [[algebra]], [[combinatorics]] and [[number theory]].
