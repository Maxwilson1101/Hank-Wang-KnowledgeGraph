# My Journey through Complex Analysis
To date, my comprehension of complex numbers has been confined to their fundamental definition and properties, as well as their apparent capacity to generalize the discussion of solutions to univariate polynomial equations. Complex numbers remain an enigmatic concept to me; for instance, their distinction from real numbers within the calculus framework, their connection to number theory, and their application in physics remain areas of intrigue and exploration.
