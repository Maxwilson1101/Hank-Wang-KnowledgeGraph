# All about my CS
Although my journey into development began with Java backend during an internship, I acknowledge that my foundation in this field is still developing. However, fueled by a passion for learning and an unwavering determination, I am committed to honing my programming prowess. I aspire to not just gain proficiency but to master that art of programming, embarking on a journey of continuous growth and improvement.

*Currently, guided by the [CSDIY Project](https://csdiy.wiki/), I am engaged in studying the [[CS 61 series]] offered by University of California, Berkley. Below is TODO list I intend to complete:*

***TODO***
- [x] `Hog Project` - `CS 61A` FA23
- [ ] Learn how to write test case using package `doctest` and `unitest`
- [x] Textbook Chapter 1.1~1.6 - `CS 61A` FA23
- [ ] `Lab1` and `Lab2` - `CS 61B` SP24
- [ ] Textbook Chapter 1~6 - `CS 61B` SP24
- [x] Reading Guide [Using Git](https://sp24.datastructur.es/resources/guides/git/) - `CS 61B` SP24

***NOTES - FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING***

*Upon the completion of `Hog Project`, I have come to realize that embracing functional programming principles represents a professional approach to methods implementation and problem-solving. Then I hand on to develop a program stimulating the process of drawing a card from a designated prize pool. Despite occasionally relying heavily on nested functions and higher-order functions, I believe this endeavor has deepened my comprehension of functional programming. Meanwhile, I encountered the challenge of determining whether to employ a class-based or higher-order function-based solution for a particular problem. In the course of my research, I found that the seminal textbook [[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]] is highly regarded by a multitude of industry professionals. Consequently, I have incorporated it into my reading materials, with the intention of uncovering comprehensive insights within this esteemed classic.*

***NOTES - DEBUGGING IN PYTHON***

*Complementing the understanding of functional programming, mastering the skills of writing test cases and debugging Python programs is deemed crucial. When confronted with a failed test case in OK, I strive to resolve this issue by mentally simulating the execution process. Nonetheless, human intuition can sometimes prove fallible. Fortunately, similar to `gdb` tool used for debugging `C`/`C++` programs, Python provides a dedicated debugging library known as `pdb`, which aids in error identifying and tracing. Hence, I must prioritize expanding my debugging toolkit by integrating the study of `doctest` and `unitest` library.*

***TODO***
- [ ] Expand my debugging toolkit, for example `doctest`, `unitest` and `pdb`
- [ ] Learn the GUI part of `Hog Project`
