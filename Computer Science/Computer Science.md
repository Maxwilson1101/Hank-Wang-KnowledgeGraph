# All about my CS
Although my journey into development began with Java backend during an internship, I acknowledge that my foundation in this field is still developing. However, fueled by a passion for learning and an unwavering determination, I am committed to honing my programming prowess. I aspire to not just gain proficiency but to master that art of programming, embarking on a journey of continuous growth and improvement.
